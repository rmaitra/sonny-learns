## Bash Basics
Unix is an operating system that many computer programmers use. Mac OS is built on Unix. Understanding how to use a Unix terminal is important for developers. On a mac, open up the terminal like so:

In the terminal you will have a prompt and a cursor blinking. There are several commands that you need to know (the prompt is denoted with the dollar sign $):
```
$ ls                        <--- list the contents of the current directory

$ cd SOME_DIRECTORY_NAME    <--- change current directory to directory called "SOME_DIRECTORY_NAME"

$ mkdir NAME                <--- create a directory with name="NAME"

$ cp FILENAME NEW_FILENAME  <--- copy a file and create a new file with same contents

$ less FILENAME             <--- open a file called FILENAME and read the contents to the screen

$ pwd                       <--- print which directory you are in (sometimes you can get lost)

$ rm FILENAME               <--- remove a file named FILENAME

$ ifconfig                  <--- print your systems network configurations (check your ip address, etc)

$ vi FILENAME               <--- vi is a text-editor for the terminal. you can open up a file and edit it, or you can create a new file.
```
Remember that when you enter a command in the terminal you need to hit enter for the terminal to read the command.
