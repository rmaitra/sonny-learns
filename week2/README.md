## 1. HTML and CSS
HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It isn't a programming language, but it is commonly confused as one. It is a markup language. It uses carrots like so ```<``` ```>``` to denote an HTML tag. The tag informs the web browser how to render the content in a tag. 

```html
<!-- this is an HTML comment, below is an unordered list -->
<ul>
   <li>One Fish</li>
   <li>Two Fish</li>
   <li>Red Fish</li>
</ul>
